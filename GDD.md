# Get Home 
### Naurway Studios

Edwin Li, Emily Gong, Lin Xin Xie 
## CORE CONCEPT
### Game Concept 
The core concept of Get Home is an objective-based battle and timed survival, where the main idea of the game is that you play as a mother duck protecting your 5 ducklings to return home to your coop before the sun sets. Once the sun sets, you will no longer be able to see your way home, making you easy prey to the wolves and other predatory animals that you can already hear closing in around you and your brood.

</p>


### Genre
The genres of the game are action, thriller and time-based survival adventure. Similar games in this genre are "Don’t Starve" (a wilderness survival game), "Terraria" and "The Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask" where a time mechanic plays a central role. However, these games were not the main influence for this project, the main games that inspired this are the Untitled Goose Game for its animal protagonist and environmental interactions, Doki Doki Literature Club and Minecraft. 
The game's concept, where a mother duck must lead her ducklings home before dark, offers a unique blend of family-oriented adventure and survival, underlined by the time constraint. The "time survival" mechanic is integral to the gameplay, adding a layer of tension as players must strategize and make decisions under time pressure.

### Unique Selling Point
What makes our game unique is that it’s a game with a visually cute theme, graphics and UI juxtaposed with a darker theme and progression. The game’s first impression should be of a cute duck family-based theme however as the game tension rises, the risk of losing your ducklings to a bloody death becomes less of a chance and more of a reality. Get Home aims to blend many different beloved features from the games that inspire us from different genres (including but not limited to Stardew Valley/MOBA point of view, and Untitled Goose Game’s endearing theme). The game centers around the theme of family and the protective instinct of the mother duck, making it a uniquely heartwarming yet thrilling experience. 

### Target Audience
The game is primarily aimed towards both casual and experienced gamers aged 10 and above, although it is not exclusive to them. It features a simple concept, straightforward controls, and light graphics making it accessible to new gamers. However, it would likely resonate better with individuals who possess a fundamental grasp of gaming controls due to its fast-paced nature and time-sensitive challenges. Players who enjoy strategy, survival, and animal-themed games will find this game particularly appealing.

## STORY AND NARRATIVE
### Backstory
You are a mother duck who, along with your brood of 5 ducklings, was taken out for an outdoor trip by your farmer to a lake in a forest. Your entire family had an amazing day out playing in the woods and water, however before you knew it, the sun had started to set and it’s only you and your family in the area, having been forgotten by your farmer when he left. You know you won’t be able to see in the dark once the sun sets which usually doesn’t pose an issue since you can simply find shelter for your family for the night. But you can hear it, feel it - the threat in the woods, and they’re only going to get more brave with the darkening sky. Thus starts the journey of guiding your family back to your home, encountering and fending off predators that aim to snatch your children for an easy meal within the 5 minutes of daylight you have.

### Characters
1. **Mama duck**:
* The mother duck is the main and only playable character in the game. She’s a single mother to 5 children and lives a peaceful life on a farm raised by the farmer. Her motivation throughout the game is to bring all her kids back home and ensure their survival in the best-case scenario. She also understands that it’s possible to lose any of her kids to the predators of the forest, so she will push through to bring back as many as she can. The mother duck is driven by her instinct to protect her offspring. 
<br> </br>
2. **Ducklings**:
* There are 5 ducklings who also live a peaceful life on a farm. Because these ducklings are so young, they rely on their mother. They are the charactesr that the player must guard from dangers and predators.

</p>

3. **Predatory Characters**
* Predators of the forest looking for an easy meal. These predators get braver and more aggressive the darker it gets in the forest, they understand that they have the high ground the moment it goes dark. They have a darker, more distinct and menacing appearance that aids in creating a sense of danger and urgency in the game.
  <br> </br>
  * **Wolves**: These predatory canines pose a significant thread to the duck family. They are known for their cunning and aggressive behaviour which is why they will attack the ducklings first.
    <p align="center">
      <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/wofl.PNG" width="300"/>
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/wolf.png" width="300"/>
    </p>
  * **Crocodiles**: These predatory characters lurk in the river, posing a threat to the ducklings whenever they are near these areas. Their distinctive reptilian appearance further enhances the sense of danger in the game.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/crocodile'.PNG" width="300"/>
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/crocodile.gif" width="300"/>
  </p>

  * **Snakes**: Snakes are only on the ground, presenting a threat to the player when walking through the map.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/snake.PNG" width="300"/>
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/snakeGIF.gif" width="300"/>
    </p>

  * **Dogs***: Dogs are also on land, with similar behaviour to wolves, the dogs are smaller and faster.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/dog.PNG" width="300"/>
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/dog.png" width="300"/>
    </p>

  * **Deers**: These inhabit the forest, they are large and deal more damage. However they are slow and players must be careful to navigate around them.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/deer.PNG" width="300"/>

    </p>
  


4. **Boss**
* The boss is a bear that guards the key to the house. Without the key, the Mother Duck and ducklings are unable to enter the house. This bear represents the ultimate challenge for the player to overcome. It is bigger, stronger, and more aggressive than the other predators, making encounters with it particularly dangerous and difficult. Which is why it is placed at the end of the game, at the peak climax.

<br></br>
## GAMEPLAY AND MECHANICS
### Player Perspective
We plan on giving the player a third-person perspective providing a panoramic view of the game world., something akin to a MOBA game, Stardew Valley and The Untitled Goose Game, giving players a view of both the character and the environment. The camera is dynamic and follows the movement of the player character to allow immersion and the players to focus on the environment instead of another control mechanic. The player character, a mother duck, is visible on screen along with the 5 ducklings and any enemy they encounter.



### Controls

The main controls will be right click for movement. The player will also have access to 3 abilities, these will be available through Q, W and E which are all easy to reach from the left side of the keyboard but these are subject to change after testing. All key-bindings will be subject to change after testing. The interaction with the game world will be primarily through these controls and the character's movement and abilities.


<p align="center">
  <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.32.13%20AM.png" width="300"/>
</p>


### Progressions
As the game advances, players face escalating challenges. They must defend their ducklings from a growing number of wolves and predatory animals that grow more aggressive as daylight fades. Players lose when either the mother duck has lost all her ducklings to the enemy predators and been killed by either the boss bear or another enemy predator. Or when they fail to reach home before sunset (i.e. when they fail to reach home before the 5 minute timer runs out), losing their ability to attack. The game's progression and its increasing difficulty lie in these growing threats and the pressure of the ticking clock.


To motivate the player, the countdown timer will be clearly visible on the UI.
<p align="center">
    <img src= "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.54.12%20AM.png" width="250"/>
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.55.03%20AM.png" width="350"/>
</p>

When the countdown reaches the final 30 seconds, the timer display turns red to signal the imminent end of the game. This creates tension and urgency, signalling to the player that time is running out, thus enhancing the game's overall suspense and excitement.
<p align="center">
    <img src= "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.58.38%20AM.png" width="250"/>
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.58.43%20AM.png" width="350"/>
</p>

If the timer turns to 0.00 and the duck is not home yet, then the game will be over and the Game Over Screen will be displayed.

Moreover, with a swarm of cute ducklings following you, how can any player not want to try their best to bring them home? Once the player reaches home, their performance will be graded by how many ducklings survive to the end. (STC - survival of player only)

<br> </br>
### Gameplay Mechanics
1. **Player Abilities** - The player will start with 3 basic abilities:
  * **Peck** - The player's basic ability. Binded to 'Q' , use this ability to fend off predators, when used in quick succession to each other and within a time frame. Knocks back the enemies.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Assets/Images/Mother%20Duck%20and%20Duckling%20Images/peck.png" width="200"/>
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/newQAbility.gif" width="500"/>
    </p>
    
  * **Wing Assault** - When 'E' is pressed, the duck to rolls forwards, allowing the player to outmaneuver the enemies. However the ducklings will not follow so the player must go back and collect them.
     <p align="center">
       <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Assets/Images/Mother%20Duck%20and%20Duckling%20Images/wing.png" width="200"/>

    </p>
   
  * **Honk Surprise** - When 'W' is pressed, an egg projectile from mama duck capable of rendering an enemy stunned in surprise, opening a window of attack for mama duck.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Assets/Images/Mother%20Duck%20and%20Duckling%20Images/honk%20.png" width="200"/>
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/wolfStun.gif" width="500"/>
   </p>

  * The abilities will have cooldowns - periods of time in which we cannot use these abilities. Once we use an abilitiy, the ability icon will be blacked out and message "On Cooldown!" will be displayed on screen"
  * If there is no target found for an ability, another message "Target Not Found" will be displayed on screen telling the player that the enemy is not within range to use that ability.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/abilityCooldown.gif" width="400"/>
  </p>
    

2. **Dynamic placement of enemies in map**
  * Enemies are placed in the map strategically and created when the game starts. They are not static and are set to wander around a set radius. If the player enters the attack range of the enemy, they will follow the duck and attack the players ducklings. If there are ducklings, the enemies will always attack the ducklings first, if there are no ducklings left, the enemies will attack the mother duck. Once the mother duck dies, the game will end. 
  * Enemy Pathfinding: Wolves will start following when the player enters their range, and will follow them until the player exits.
    <p align="center">
      <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/enemiesUI.png" width="400"/>
    </p>
    
3. **Enemies**:
  * **Wolves, Dogs, Deers, Snakes**: These are the land predators. They attack by stalking the ducklings when they come within range, if the predators reach the ducklings, they will lunge and bite them, dealing a certain amount of damage. This continues to happen as long as the ducklings are near them. Land predators can target mama duck but will always change to a duckling if available.
    <p align="center">
     <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/wolf.gif" width="400"/>
    </p>

  * **Crocodiles**: These reside in the river only, they attack the duck by biting and deals damage to the duck and ducklings when they are within range.
    <p align="center">
     <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/crocodileGif.gif" width="400"/>
    </p>
    
  * **Boss Bear**: Appears near the end right before the duck and ducklings reach home. The bear will be able to knock up ducklings and deal more damage, it will also have more health making it harder to defeat. The bear also has the most health so it will take more damage to defeat.
    <p align="center">
     <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/bear.gif" width="400"/>
    </p>


4. **Battle - strategies and mechanics:**
* The player has the option to kill any predators using the available abilities but this leaves the ducklings vulnerable and at risk of losing health.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/WolfDeath%2BBlood.gif" width="400"/>
  </p>
* The enemies will be able to reach and attack the last duckling in your line, tha means you will have a small window of opportunity to use your abilities to get the enemy to let go of your child. You have the option to stun them then attack or straight attack with peck in quick succession, which when done fast enough will get the enemy to let go and disengage.
  <p align="center">

    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/WolfAttackingDucklings.gif" width="375"/>
  </p>

* Ducklings lost to enemies will be lost permanently.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%2012.51.41%20AM.png" width="400"/>
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/ducklingDeath.gif" width="200"/>
  </p>
  
* After every moving entity dies, they will have a death animation and a blood splatter that is from the blood particle system we used. This helps to enhance the visual effects of the game and help to emphasise the death of a character more. 

* Ducklings will only follow the mama duck if she is not too far away. If too far, the ducklings will remain stationary with a question mark around their icon.  If mama duck comes back, the question mark around their icon will disappear and the duck will follow mama duck again.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/Screenshot%202023-10-31%20at%201.54.27%20AM.png" width="80" />
  </p>

* When the player gets near the boss, they will be locked in the boss arena where they must defeat the boss and obtain a key to be able to leave and get home.
  <p align="center">
    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/main/Images/bossFight.gif" width="500"/>
  </p>
  
* During the Boss battle, the bear is able to knock up the mother duck and ducklings, introducing a new exciting challenge into the game battle.

  </p>

6. Time Limit: As the limit approaches, the sun lowers leading to decreased vision. When time is up, the game will fade out to a black screen, and audio will indicate that the ducks have been overwhelmed by the predators.
   <p align="center">
     <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/sunrise.gif" width= "400"/>
   </p>

7. Interactive Environment: There will be water (either as a river or a pond) which will slow you down, and as wolves will not be able to pass water, will disengage them automatically. Mud puddles will slow you down if stepped on and not avoided, etc.
<p align="center">

</p>

8. Items in Game: The player will be able to pick up 2 items in game to enhance their abilities:
   * Speed Mushroom - Gain 5 second speed boost
   * Health Tomato - Health up to max health for all ducks

## LEVELS AND WORLD DESIGN
### Game World
The game world is 3D polyart-centric where the player progresses forward through a forest at sunset. Our world is only one level but progresses through and initiates different difficulties flagged by time. The environment that our players encounter and see is largely a worn forest floor and trail which is the main path of travel, flanked on both sides by trees and bushes to create the forest environment. Elements are subject to change depending on available assets for all options. The player will occasionally encounter a river that cuts horizontally across the map and mud puddles as interference. We aim to have the player restricted to the trail. There will be an arrow near the top of the screen that will give a general idea of where the character should go in order to make it home and the game will be restricted to two axes but still rendered in a 3D environment. Below is an example created in Unity.
<p align="center">
  <img src= "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/world.png" alt="Image 1 Description" width = "480"/>
  <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/worldLook.png" width="480"/>
</p>

* **The Map will also feature several different areas:**
  * The area where the boss is located
    
<p align="center">

  <img src= "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/bearMap-v2.png" width="500"/>
</p>

  * The river, contains fish and crocodiles
  
<p align="center">

  <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/GDD_Update/Images/riverView2.png" width="500"/>
</p>



### Objects
The objects we have in the game are our enemy entities. All assets are low poly in style. When the duck collider collides with water, the duck swimming animation will activate and the movement speed of the duck slows. When the duck touches mud, the duck will also slow down but the animation will stay the same. More on interactions in the next section. 

Particles systems include fireflies and blood systems for immersion.
<p align="center">
  <img src = "https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/assets/19798018/3caa73a4-1030-4a43-9c4d-cc6f67f7ef31" width = "550"/>
</p>

The environmental physics we have are the interactions between the mud/water(river) and the player, and we aim to have their effects both visual and game-related implemented into the game (speed/slow).  Next is the interaction between the player and the enemies, all are collideable with each other. The only other interaction to note is between the ability Wing Assault where there is a knockback mechanic between the player and the wolves.

For example, when the duck enters the water, their speed will slow down and they will start swimming. 
This creates a change of pace in the game and introduces a new challenge into the game. The duck must cross the river and avoid the crocodiles under the time pressure.

## ART AND AUDIO
### Art Style
We aim for the art style of the game to be of a low poly style, similar to the image that is below. This style will be consistent across the game, including the forest environment, the villains and our main character and family. We aim for the colours to be vibrant in order to stay consistent with the feeling of the art style, however, base colours will look different after effects of potentially shaders for the effect of sunset and visibility. Refer below for an example created in Unity  with potential assets.

</p>

**Shaders**
* We also implemented two shaders to visually enhance our map and graphics of the game.
* We implemented a 'toon-like' water shader that gives the water texture and movement making it seem like there are waves rippling through the water. The shader also gives it a toon-like look to fit into the game's style.

    <img src="https://github.com/COMP30019/project-2-naurway-studios/blob/main/Images/waterArt.png" width="300"/>
  </p>
* We also added another celshader to enhance the colour and visuals of the map, giving it a more cartoon like look and bolder outlines. Outlines were also added through using stencil buffer operation to further enhance the toon effect and to not lose the objects inherent shape to the colours.
  


### Sound and Music
We aim for something akin and inspired by Doki Doki Literature Club, quiet background music with environmental noises such as trees rustling and wind blowing. We aim to have sound cues for when difficulty increases in the set minute intervals (i.e: wolves howling) and a falcon screech when the alert for falcon incoming is on screen.

## USER INTERFACE (UI)
The game’s UI is simple, we want everything to have a soft, round feel to it. We have attached an example for the sample UI for the game. The aesthetic should feel in line with the game’s poly art cute style, however have colours that are slightly less saturated compared to the game’s palette to draw less attention away from the main game. A menu can potentially be added for rebinding of keys as an extension.

</p>

**Health UI**
* Every moving entity (excluding Fish) will have a health bar above it. This indicates the percentage of health left before the moving entity is dead.
* The colour of the health UI distinguishes which entity it is:
  * Yellow - Mother Duck
  * Green - Ducklings, when the ducklings are very low health and are about to die, the UI health bar will turn red.
  * Red - Enemies.

Here we have used the website Trello to create a board for our Project. This is convenient as it allows us to create lists and cards to track tasks and subtasks. Each team member is able to assign tasks, set due dates, and track project progress. 
Also having each part of the project laid out in a board like view helps to visualise the workflow and progress of the project. 


## TEAM COMMUNICATION, TIMELINES AND TASK ASSIGNMENT
Development:
* We will first develop the base game, creating any basic interfaces and abstract classes needed for the project. 
* Once the basic features are implemented, new features will be assigned to each group member. (e.g. implement the fog of war as the night gets dark). 
* Tasks during this step of the project will be distributed in a meeting to ensure equal and comfortability between members with workload and task. Communication will be either online through text or calls using Discord or in person. Tasks will be delegated through communication as well.
* We will use branches on Github to keep track of features, and a merge request will be required to enable the feature in the main branch.
* All committed code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before merging.
* Any non-code features (e.g. UI, visual design, Audio Effects, etc.) should follow the same idea. Progress will be regularly updated both on Trello and to members. 
* The art and sound design will be skill-specific tasks delegated to individual members of the team for consistency across the entire project. 
* Code should not be allowed to be directly committed into the main branch.
* We will communicate in English.
* We also used the website trello to divide tasks. By separating tasks in to Core Gameplay/Audio, Shaders/Special FX, Animation/UI Graphics, GDD/Project Organisation and Evaluation/Report, we were able to choose which tasks we wanted to do. And also keep track of our progress. Visually as well, you can see who is doing which tasks, this ensures equal responsibilities are given to each team member as we can see the workload of each team member.
* Additionallity, Trello also facilitates communication between team members through comments and notifications, this ensures everyone stays updated with the latest changes and discussions.

## POSSIBLE CHALLENGES
Some potential problems we foresee happening include being able to effectively use Unity to create the game and implement all our ideas into the game. Being able to create the game mechanics we wish to achieve alongside making sure all the objects and images are rendered correctly. Time management, if not managed correctly, may result in a game not meeting up to our expected standard.

The way we plan to address these issues includes utilising online resources to help us further understand Unity and how to write the scripts in accordance with our plan. 
We should also start working on this game early and be flexible so that we can adjust and adapt our game whenever we encounter challenges technically. 
Prototyping and frequent testing is also essential to track our progress and resolve issues early on to prevent difficulties further into the game development

## POTENTIAL EXPANSIONS
* Cutscene: Cutscenes throughout the game, i.e: when a duckling dies, or when you first encounter a new terrain
Upgrades, Items and Power Ups: The map has a chance to drop items, upgrades and power ups that alter the gameplay. 
* NPCs: Interactable NPCs which give power ups, new abilities, cut scenes. 
* Procedural Generation: multiple chunks of the map will be pre-built, and an algorithm will stitch the chunks together to create a unique map on every play through. (Below is an example taken from the Minecraft Gamemode “Hypixel Skyblock Dungeons”. A map is generated on every play, making the experience non-repetitive.)
