GameTitle: Get Home
GameBlurb: In "Get Home", players assume the role of a mother duck striving to lead her five ducklings safely back to their coop before sundown, when predatory wolves emerge. Set in a farmland forest, this timed survival game takes a dark twist as players combat growing threats to protect their family. Adopting a third-person MOBA-style perspective, players utilize skills such as "Peck", "Wing Assault", and "Honk Surprise" to fend off predators. As daylight wanes, challenges intensify with heightened enemy aggression. Environmental elements, like rivers and mud puddles, add strategic depth. Though reminiscent of games like "Untitled Goose Game" and "Stardew Valley", "Get Home" offers a unique blend of cuteness and tension, emphasizing themes of family and survival in a 3D polyart forest setting. With each passing moment, the stakes rise, making the quest to secure the safety of the ducklings both heartwarming and thrilling.
